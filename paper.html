  <h3><b>Feedback about my works</b></h3>
  <p>Five years have passed, and I've remained actively involved in the IT industry.</p>
  <p>One thing that still bothers me is the use of smartphones in Hong Kong.</p> 
  <p>Users know how expensive smartphones are; they pay for a phone and expect telecommunications services.</p> 
  <p>I also worked in a data center before, where building a cloud infrastructure required a lot of equipment, such as servers, computers, firewalls, switches, and backup power.</p> 
  <p>Technically, that equipment was designed using X-ray, Q-tron, and kernel fission principles.</p>
  <p>I'm a programmer at Arm, responsible for writing code.</p> 
  <p>I designed Kubernetes using Web and MATLAB, and my teacher supported us with ASP.NET.</p> 
  <p>Microsoft acquired it after learning about it. <p>Kubernetes is now widely used, and my coding work has come to an end.</p> 
  <p>I hope that while using Kubernetes, everyone will support ARM's development.</p> 
  <p>Special thanks to Michael and Presh, jockeys at the Hong Kong Jockey Club.</p> 
  <p>Their teaching was very difficult because the intelligence of the Chinese people is only average.</p> 
  <p>I will continue to live in Hong Kong, and I hope my parents know about my contributions.</p>
